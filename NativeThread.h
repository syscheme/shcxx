/// thread exception is thrown if the thread cannot be created. Derived from the class Thread,
/// threads can be as objects. 1) At minimum the "Run" method must be implemented, and this
/// method essentially is the "thread", for it is executed within the execution context of
/// the thread, and when the Run method terminates the thread is assumed to have terminated.
/// 2) Threads can be "suspended" and "resumed". As this behavior is not defined in the Posix 
/// pthread specification, it is often emulated through signals.
